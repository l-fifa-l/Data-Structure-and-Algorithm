    "<h4>An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).\n",
    "Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.\n",
    "Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. \n",

    "Input: \n",
    "N = 3\n",
    "arr[] = {1,2,3}\n",
    "Possible Answer: 2\n",
    "Generated Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: index 2 is 3.\n",
    "It is the peak element as it is \n",
    "greater than its neighbour 2.\n",
    "If 2 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.\n",

    "N = 2\n",
    "arr[] = {3,4}\n",
    "Possible Answer: 1\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: 4 (at index 1) is the \n",
    "peak element as it is greater than \n",
    "its only neighbour element 3.\n",

    "Your Task:\n",
